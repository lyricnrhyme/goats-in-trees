GOATS IN TREES
///////////////

If you ever google "Goats in Trees", you'll find a lovely bouquet of goats on top a tree. Why do they do this you ask? Climbing is in a goat's nature and anything they climb is their home! Help the goats find their place on the tree so they can all be happy! Use the directional pad to position falling goats onto the branches available. The more goats, the happier the tree! And whatever you do, DO NOT PRESS THE BIG RED BUTTON!!
